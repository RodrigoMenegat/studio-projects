# KEEP TRACK OF STUFF

> What to do with the streets that have very common names or are homonims?
I decided to manually filter those. In the case that the name was really common, such as "João Maria", I only kept the street names that actively identified the person -- saying something like "Soldier João Maria" or something similar. I followed the same criteria for homonims - Antônia Bandeira was the most common of those, since it refers to a military officer and to a brazilian artists who has nothing to do with the dictatorship.
