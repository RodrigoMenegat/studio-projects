I am a reporter that tries to tell stories with data. I already worked in a big newsroom, as a freelancer and in a university vased photojournalism team. I write a blog about noisy music (which is kind of dead now, sadly), like sports quite a lot and I will probably bore you talking about things I obsess with, like politics and liretature and video-games. 23, from Brazil, graduated from my hometown State University of Ponta Grossa (UEPG), now studying at the Columbia J-School in New York City.
