I am a reporter that tries to tell stories with data. I already [worked in a big newsroom](http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/olimpiada-no-rio/2016/08/1805566-grupo-de-potencias-cai-e-paises-menos-tradicionais-levam-mais-ouros-na-rio-2016.shtml), [as a freelancer](https://theintercept.com/2017/04/27/relacao-entre-odebrecht-e-politicos-contaminou-obras-da-amazonia-a-fronteira-com-o-uruguai/?comments=1#comments) and in a university based [photojournalism team](https://www.flickr.com/search/?tags=rodrigomenegat). I write a [blog about bad music](http://screambloggore.com/) and I will probably bore you to death talking about things I obsess with, like politics and literature and video-games. I am 23 years-old, from Brazil, graduated from my hometown's State University of Ponta Grossa (UEPG) and I am now studying data journalism at the Columbia University J-School in New York City.

Here's my [stories portfolio](https://rodrigomenegat.journoportfolio.com/) and here are [some of my photos](https://500px.com/rodrigoschuinski/galleries).
