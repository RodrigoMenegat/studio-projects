I am a reporter that tries to tell stories with data. I already [worked in a big newsroom](http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/olimpiada-no-rio/2016/08/1805566-grupo-de-potencias-cai-e-paises-menos-tradicionais-levam-mais-ouros-na-rio-2016.shtml), [as a freelancer](https://theintercept.com/2017/04/27/relacao-entre-odebrecht-e-politicos-contaminou-obras-da-amazonia-a-fronteira-com-o-uruguai/?comments=1#comments) and in a university based [photojournalism team](https://www.flickr.com/search/?tags=rodrigomenegat). I write a [blog about noisy music](http://screambloggore.com/) (which is kind of dead now, sadly), like sports quite a lot and I will probably bore you talking about things I obsess with, like politics and liretature and video-games. 23, from Brazil, graduated from my hometown State University of Ponta Grossa (UEPG), now studying data journalism at the Columbia J-School in New York City.

Here's my [stories portfolio](https://rodrigomenegat.journoportfolio.com/), here are [some of my photos](https://500px.com/rodrigoschuinski/galleries) and here's me with some college classmates in the background:
