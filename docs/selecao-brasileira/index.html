      <h3>Neymar is an early star in the Seleção. But can he top the legends?</h3>

      <p>At age 25, Neymar is already among the top 5 all-time scorers for the Brazilian National Team. In front of him, only the legends Pelé, Ronaldo, Romário and Zico. Only one of those, the former midfielder from Flamengo, had more goals than Neymar at this age - Zico, though, suffered with severe injuries in his later carrer and lost pace. Can the PSG forward keep up with the expectations and become the most lethal Brazilian striker ever? </p>
