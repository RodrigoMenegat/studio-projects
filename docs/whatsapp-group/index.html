      <h3>I text a lot</h3>

      <p>Using the text logs from six months of group chat, I decided to visualize how a close group of my friends communicates on WhatsApp. The results? I talk too much, sometimes we get really hypochondriac and we chat a lot during work hours. Shame on us.  </p>

      <h3>No respect for work hours</h3>
      <p>Think of this chart as a clock. A weird non-circular 24-hour clock, but a clock nevertheless. The longer the pie slice, the more messages were sent in that hour of the day. This shows that my friends only <b>really</b> start texting in the late morning. Chat gets really intense on lunch, but lasts only until we get to work, around 12 PM... Nevertheless, after a while the boredom of newsroom life strikes and we text and text and text and text until we sleep. Pretty exciting.</p>
